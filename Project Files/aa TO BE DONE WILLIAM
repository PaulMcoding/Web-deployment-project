so yesterday i made it so you can send custom messages to the seller, take a look at sending a message in the detailedcarview
page, then go to my cars and read messages there.

work for you to do today:
    clean up the my cars and updating car 

        for mycars section we want to have an add and update button that leads us elswhere to not have the page be chock full
        of things.

        for updating car we want it to be if you click it should be tied to a specific car like the delete is, you can click in
        and its pre populated and you just have to change the values.

        just take a look around the website and see if theres anything glaring that needs to be changed at all

After they are done the project is finished.
